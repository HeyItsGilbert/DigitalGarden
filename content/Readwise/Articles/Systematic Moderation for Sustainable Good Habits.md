  **Systematic Moderation.** Everybody from Aristotle to your Grandma agrees that moderation is a good idea. It's the wisdom of the philosophers and the virtue of the common folk. At least, it used to be. These days it's no longer held in such high esteem -- and even more rarely practiced. Instead, people look for ways to get around having to moderate their desires and inclinations: with pills, miracle products, even surgery. Or they simply ignore their desires altogether and embark on impossibly ambitious and restrictive programs of self-discipline. But if there's a way around moderation, we clearly haven't found it yet; as the relentless rise in obesity rates and other depressing metrics make plain, our modern workarounds simply don't work. ^987007387

Note: It's funny how we avoid moderation so much that we prefer to go cold turkey and feel terrible when we fail. Simply turning the knob enough to make it a challenge over time would be easier.

  Compliance with rules requires willpower, and willpower is a very limited commodity. A good system of moderation will utilize this resource efficiently by focusing on building *habits*: semi-automatic behaviors that require little willpower to maintain once they've been established. ^987007493

Note: I like that it acknowledges that willpower is limited. Systems that rely on it tend to make us feel bad when we fail.
