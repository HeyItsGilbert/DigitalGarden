That team should write libraries, generate examples, and drive standardization; ushering in consistency, predictability, and usability. They should partner with internal teams to evaluate use cases. They should partner with your vendors as roadmap stakeholders. They might also write glue code and helper modules to connect disparate data sources and create cohesive visualizations. Basically, that team becomes an integration point between your organization and the outsourced work. ^427823823

If your chosen company isn’t solving an infrastructure problem for the world, there are still loads of opportunities for ops generalists here too. But know that a core part of your job is critically examining the cycles your company devotes to infrastructure operations and finding effective ways to outsource or minimize their in-house developer cycles. Your job is *not* to go deep if there is any alternative. ^427825314

If you ship software, you have operations work that needs to be done. That work isn’t going away. It’s just moving up the stack and becoming more sophisticated, and you might not recognize it. ^427826220
