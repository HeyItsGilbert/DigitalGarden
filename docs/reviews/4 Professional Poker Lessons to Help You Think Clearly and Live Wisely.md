Liv Boeree covers some biases that show up in our day-to-day lives that we often can see in poker.
## Confirmation Bias
  > The most damaging bias that can come up in poker and I also think very often in life is what's known as confirmation bias.

The desire to want something to and to overvalue evidence that would confirm that, and undervalue evidence that disproves that.
## Status Quo Bias
> Status quo bias is basically when we [...] whenever we catch ourselves saying well it's always been done this way, or it's worked for me like this in the past and this is my way of doing things.

In poker this could mean playing with a certain style that doesn't account for the other players.
## Sunk Cost Fallacy
> Another classic one that comes up in poker is the sunk cost fallacy where again you'll have a lot of chips perhap salmost all of your stack is in the middle and yet you are 85 to 90 percent confident that you have the worst hand and [...] you're putting another chip in the pot is probably not a good idea but we'll often go to ourselves "oh well I put I've gone this far I've put this much in I might as well see it through to the end"

A very common situation where we fail to consider new information.
## Emotional Difference
> it's interesting to observe sort of the difference in emotion you can have when you end up in a very similar situation.

Example she gives is where she loses a number of chips to get to N vs when she's won a hand to get the same number of chips. This gain or loss could affect you emotionally when in reality you have the same number of chips.
