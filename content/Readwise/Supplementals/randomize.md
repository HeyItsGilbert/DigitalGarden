  “Quantum physics doesn’t make any sense,” she said. “Please don’t try to think about it too much. It can be very distressing.” ^535332228

  “That does sound solid, but remember a system is only as secure as the humans who operate it.” ^779877289

  Her parents knew they’d never find her a man as smart as she was. So they focused on “smart enough not to be left behind.” Prashant was brilliant in his own ways. It was a wonderful match. ^779877292

  At times he was a complicated man, but at other times he could be very simple. Finding those simple moments and bringing him joy was one of Sumi’s greatest pleasures. ^779877293

  There’s no such thing as an actual random-number generator. Computers create pseudorandom numbers.” “What’s the difference?” “Pseudorandom numbers are made with a complicated math formula. You plug one number in—called the seed, or the starting point, for the mathematical formula—and you get a sequence of seemingly random numbers out. The formula has exponentiation and remainders and all sorts of other stuff to make it non-reverse-engineerable.” ^779877296

  “You’re more intelligent than I could ever hope to be. I feel no shame in admitting it. But there’s no substitute for experience. ^779877297

  “Quantum computing is a totally different animal than normal computing,” he began. “It takes advantage of weird quantum physics properties like superposition and entanglement to solve math problems. It’s usually way slower than normal computers at math, but for some problems, it’s exponentially faster.” ^779877298

  But in a city of extreme displays, silent quality appealed to Rutledge more than a neon sign saying I’M IMPORTANT. ^941287386

  “Once they’re entangled, they are guaranteed to be the same when randomized.” ^941287387

---
  Our long-term storage unit is in our vault. You’ve never been in our vault. But I bet there’s some skin cells of yours on it from when you handled it before.” ^941287388

---
  “We fight quantum with quantum.” ^941287389

---
  “All that matters is that the system has a minor performance optimization that creates the security hole we’re going to take advantage of.” ^941287390

---
  “Two parties can’t communicate via quantum measurements. But they can both observe their respective results and act accordingly.” ^941287391

  He wasn’t about revenge or money. He was about respect. ^941287392

  She pressed on. “Our new company will make quantum random-number generators. Our product will just be a box that makes a stream of truly random numbers via quantum properties and outputs them at a steady rate. No configuration. No operating system. Just a serial port.” ^941287393

---
  She packed three immaculately ironed and folded white shirts, along with two pairs of black slacks. She added two blue ties and threw in a red one just for fun. He looked so handsome with a red tie on, but he always wore blue. ^941287394

  Andy Weir is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Martian, which was adapted into an Academy Award–nominated film directed by Ridley Scott. A devoted hobbyist of such subjects as relativistic physics and orbital mechanics, he’s also the author of Artemis. He lives in California. ^941287395
