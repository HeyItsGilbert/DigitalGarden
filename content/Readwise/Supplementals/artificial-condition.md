# Highlights


  Young humans can be impulsive. The trick is keeping them around long enough to become old humans. This is what my crew tells me and my own observations seem to confirm it. ^680109599

  “Sometimes people do things to you that you can’t do anything about. You just have to survive it and go on.” ^680109600

  I phrased it as a question, because pretending you were asking for more information was the best way to try to get the humans to realize they were doing something stupid. “So do you think there’s another reason Tlacey wants you to do this exchange in person, other than … killing you?” ^680109602

  “In the creche, our moms always said that fear was an artificial condition. It’s imposed from the outside. So it’s possible to fight it. You should do the things you’re afraid of.” ^680109603

  When a major character died in the twentieth episode I had to pause seven minutes while it sat there in the feed doing the bot equivalent of staring at a wall, pretending that it had to run diagnostics. Then four episodes later the character came back to life and it was so relieved we had to watch that episode three times before it would go on. ^680109604

  I guess you can’t tell a story from the point of view of something that you don’t think has a point of view. ^680109605

  I was used to taking orders from humans and trying to mitigate whatever damage their stupid ideas did to them, but I had wanted to work with a group again, I had enjoyed how they had listened to me, I had put my need to get to RaviHyral above the safety of my clients. I was just as shit at being a security consultant as any human. ^680109607

  So they made us smarter. The anxiety and depression were side effects. ^680109608

  Its function was traveling through what it thought of as the endlessly fascinating sensation of space, and keeping all its human and otherwise passengers safe inside its metal body. Of course it didn’t understand not wanting to perform your function. Its function was great. ^810086306

  The tension that had kept me down to 96 percent capacity eased; a murderbot’s life is stressful in general, but it would be a long time before I got used to moving through human spaces with no armor, no way to hide my face. ^810086307

  I felt this would be the point where a human would sigh, so I sighed. ^810086309

  And now I knew why I hadn’t wanted to do this. It would make it harder for me to pretend not to be a person. ^810086314

  If it happened, did you cause it to happen, or did an outside influence use you to cause it to happen? ^879658512

  Humans and augmented humans shift their weight when they stand, they react to sudden sounds and bright lights, they scratch themselves, they adjust their hair, they look in their pockets or bags to check for things that they already know are in there. ^879658513

  I’m accustomed to assisting my crew with large-scale data analysis, and numerous other experiments. While I am in transport mode, I find my unused capacity tiresome. Solving your problems is an interesting exercise in lateral thinking. ^879658514

  “I need to know if the incident occurred due to a catastrophic failure of my governor module. That’s what I think happened. But I need to know for sure.” I hesitated, but what the hell, it already knew everything else. “I need to know if I hacked my governor module in order to cause the incident.” ^879658518

  It explained, When my crew plays media, I can’t process the context. Human interactions and environments outside my hull are largely unfamiliar. Now I understood. It needed to read my reactions to the show to really understand what was happening. Humans used the feed in different ways than bots (and constructs) so when its crew played their media, their reactions didn’t become part of the data. ^879658519

  That is irrational. I know, I said, if the humans were dead, who would make the media? It was so outrageous, it sounded like something a human would say. ^879658520

  Are all constructs so illogical? said the Asshole Research Transport with the immense processing capability whose metaphorical hand I had had to hold because it had become emotionally compromised by a fictional media serial. ^879658521
