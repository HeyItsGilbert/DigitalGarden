# Highlights

When engineering a system, physical or informational, the bugs you encounter will always, by necessity, be ever so slightly more clever than you were when you designed the thing.

Therefore, you want to engineer the least clever possible system that you can get away with, so as to ensure that your bugs don't end up beyond your absolute capacity for cleverness. ^533087580
