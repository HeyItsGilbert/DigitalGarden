# Highlights

Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself, because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good, its effects are comical and then monstrous. ^662646656

---
What humans require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose, you could say, is like passion with boundaries. Realism is detachment and perspective. ^662646657

---
An amateur is defensive. The professional finds learning (and even, occasionally, being shown up) to be enjoyable; they like being challenged and humbled, and engage in education as an ongoing and endless process. ^662646658

---
Pride blunts the very instrument we need to own in order to succeed: our mind. Our ability to learn, to adapt, to be flexible, to build relationships, all of this is dulled by pride. ^662646659

The pretense of knowledge is our most dangerous vice, because it prevents us from getting any better. Studious self-assessment is the antidote. ^662646660

---
Greatness comes from humble beginnings; it comes from grunt work. It means you’re the least important person in the room—until you change that with results. ^662646661

---
Ego needs honors in order to be validated. Confidence, on the other hand, is able to wait and focus on the task at hand regardless of external recognition. ^662646662

---
The only relationship between work and chatter is that one kills the other. ^662646663

---
So what is scarce and rare? The ability to deliberately keep yourself out of the conversation and subsist without its validation. Silence is the respite of the confident and the strong. ^662646664

---
The ego we see most commonly goes by a more casual definition: an unhealthy belief in our own importance. Self-centered ambition. ^662646665
