# Highlights


  Our most basic emotional need is not to fall in love but to be genuinely loved by another, to know a love that grows out of reason and choice, not instinct. I need to be loved by someone who chooses to love me, who sees in me something worth loving. ^779877934

  In fact, love is always freely given. Love cannot be demanded. We can request things of each other, but we must never demand anything. Requests give direction to love, but demands stop the flow of love.” ^779877938

  Listen for feelings. Ask yourself, “What emotion is my spouse experiencing?” When you think you have the answer, confirm it. For example, “It sounds to me like you are feeling disappointed because I forgot____________.” That gives him the chance to clarify his feelings. It also communicates that you are listening intently to what he is saying. ^779877939

  Love doesn’t keep a score of wrongs. Love doesn’t bring up past failures. ^779877945

  And where do we find time for such activities, especially if both of us have vocations outside the home? We make time just as we make time for lunch and dinner. Because it is just as essential to our marriage as meals are to our health. Is it difficult? Does it take careful planning? Does it mean we have to give up some individual activities? Does it mean we do some things we don’t particularly enjoy? Is it worth it? Without a doubt. What’s in it for me? The pleasure of living with a spouse who feels loved and knowing that I have learned to speak his or her love language fluently. ^870236864
