People survived by being cautious, but they got ahead by being bold. ^637136713

“Everyone thinks I have a death wish, you know? But I don’t want to die—dying is easy. No, I want to live, but getting close to death is the only way to feel alive. And once you do, it makes you realize that everything you were doing before wasn’t actually living. It was just making do. Call me crazy, but I think we do the best living when the stakes are high.” ^637136714

Magic and magician must between them balance. Magic itself is chaos. The magician must be calm. A fractured self is a poor vessel for power, spilling power without focus or measure from every crack. ^637136719

The truth was, Lila understood why Alucard did it. Why he traded safety and boredom for adventure. She didn’t know what it felt like to be safe, and she’d never had the luxury of being bored, but it was like she’d once told Kell. People either stole to stay alive or to feel alive. She had to imagine that they ran away for the same reasons. ^637136720

He downed the drink, hoping it would render him in better spirits, but it dulled the world without ever touching his thoughts. ^637136721

“I honestly don’t know whether to be impressed or unnerved.” Lila straightened. “The two aren’t mutually exclusive.” ^637136722
