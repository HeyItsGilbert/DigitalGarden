# Highlights

“Love and loss,” he said, “are like a ship and the sea. They rise together. The more we love, the more we have to lose. But the only way to avoid loss is to avoid love. And what a sad world that would be.” ^646104160

This is why I run. Because caring was a thing with claws. It sank them in, and didn’t let go. Caring hurt more than a knife to the leg, more than a few broken ribs, more than anything that bled or broke and healed again. Caring didn’t break you clean. It was a bone that didn’t set, a cut that wouldn’t close. ^646104163

---
“Death comes for us all,” said Holland evenly. “I would simply have mine mean something.” ^646104166

---

---
“It doesn’t matter what someone is. Only what they think they are.” ^646104168
