  There had already been much talk in the citadel about Mithrandir’s companion and his long closeting with the Lord; and rumour declared that a Prince of the Halflings had come out of the North to offer allegiance to Gondor and five thousand swords. And some said that when the Riders came from Rohan each would bring behind him a halfling warrior, small maybe, but doughty.

  Yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule. ([2752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007978P18&location=2752)) %% Color: yellow %% ^923065488

  With that he carried all the gear away to one of the many gaping fissures that scored the land and threw them in. The clatter of his precious pans as they fell down into the dark was like a death-knell to his heart.

  It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them. ([5696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007978P18&location=5696)) %% Color: yellow %% ^937497605

  ‘Yes,’ said Gandalf; ‘for it will be better to ride back three together than one alone. Well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the Sea comes the end of our fellowship in Middle-earth. Go in peace! I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.’ ([5719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007978P18&location=5719)) %% Color: yellow %% ^937497606
