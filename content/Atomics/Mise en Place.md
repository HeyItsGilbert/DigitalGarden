Mise en place can be an excellent metaphor about the value of preparing before you start. 

> There are 5 steps to mise en place:
> 
>1. Know your recipe — necessary ingredients, cookware, and baking times
> 2. Prepare your ingredients — clean, chop, mince… whatever is required
> 3. Arrange your ingredients — appropriate size bowls, positioned logically
> 4. Prepare your workstation — set the oven temperature, clean the utensils
> 5. Arrange your tools — similar logic applied to cookware and necessary equipment
