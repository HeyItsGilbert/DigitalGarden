  There is no good or bad without us, there is only perception. There is the event itself and the story we tell ourselves about what it means. ^348313210

  There is always a countermove, always an escape or a way through, so there is no reason to get worked up. No one said it would be easy and, of course, the stakes are high, but the path is there for those ready to take it. ^348313211  
  
Tags: #perception, #stoic

  “The obstacle in the path becomes the path. Never forget, within every obstacle is an opportunity to improve our condition.” ^348313212

  In life our first job is this, to divide and distinguish things into two categories: externals I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to them I do control. Where will I find good and bad? In me, in my choices. ^348313213

  Don’t let the force of an impression when it first hit you knock you off your feet; just say to it: Hold on a moment; let me see who you are and what you represent. Let me put you to the test. ^348313214  
  
Tags: #perception

  The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way. ^348313215  
  
Tags: #stoic

  Where the head goes, the body follows. Perception precedes action. Right action follows the right perspective. ^348313216  
  
Tags: #action, #favorite, #motivation, #perception, #stoic

  Objective judgment, now at this very moment. Unselfish action, now at this very moment. Willing acceptance—now at this very moment—of all external events. That’s all you need. ^348313217

  Our perceptions determine, to an incredibly large degree, what we are and are not capable of. In many ways, they determine reality itself. ^348313218

  Every obstacle is unique to each of us. But the responses they elicit are the same: Fear. Frustration. Helplessness. Depression. ^348313219

  Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become the next moment. By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant. ^514515349

  “Bad companies are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them.” ^514515350  
  
Tags: #perception, #problem_solving, #stoic, #work  
  
---  
  See things for what they are. Do what we can. Endure and bear what we must. What blocked the path now is a path. What once impeded action advances action. The Obstacle is the Way. ^514515351

  Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been. ^514515352  
  
Tags: #perspective, #problem_solving

  You will come across obstacles in life—fair and unfair. And you will discover, time and time again, that what matters most is not what these obstacles are but how we see them, how we react to them, and whether we keep our composure. ^514515353

  Focusing exclusively on what is in our power magnifies and enhances our power. ^514515354

  “The Things which hurt,” Benjamin Franklin wrote, “instruct.” ^514515355

  In the meantime, cling tooth and nail to the following rule: not to give in to adversity, not to trust prosperity, and always take full note of fortune’s habit of behaving just as she pleases. ^514515356  
  
Tags: #stoic

  “Nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so,” as Shakespeare put it. ^514515357  
  
Tags: #stoic  
  
---  
  If we’re to overcome our obstacles, this is the message to broadcast—internally and externally. We will not be stopped by failure, we will not be rushed or distracted by external noise. We will chisel and peg away at the obstacle until it is gone. Resistance is futile. ^514515358

  Real strength lies in the control or, as Nassim Taleb put it, the domestication of one’s emotions, not in pretending they don’t exist. ^609666987

  “Don’t think about winning the SEC Championship. Don’t think about the national championship. Think about what you needed to do in this drill, on this play, in this moment. That’s the process: Let’s think about what we can do today, the task at hand.” ^609666988  
  
Tags: #present, #progress, #stoic

  Being trapped is just a position, not a fate. You get out of it by addressing and eliminating each part of that position through small, deliberate actions—not by trying (and failing) to push it away with superhuman strength. ^609666989

  God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change The courage to change the things I can, And the wisdom to know the difference. ^609666991  
  
Tags: #courage, #stoic, #wisdom

  First, see clearly. Next, act correctly. Finally, endure and accept the world as it is. ^609666993  
  
Tags: #stoic

  The process is about doing the right things, right now. Not worrying about what might happen later, or the results, or the whole picture. ^609666994  
  
Tags: #process, #systems  
  
---  
  A good person dyes events with his own color . and turns whatever happens to his own benefit. ^609666995

  My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it . but love it. ^609666996

  We must all either wear out or rust out, every one of us. My choice is to wear out. ^660123334  
  
Tags: #exercise, #stoic

  Just because the conditions aren’t exactly to your liking, or you don’t feel ready yet, doesn’t mean you get a pass. If you want momentum, you’ll have to create it yourself, right now, by getting up and getting started. ^660123335  
  
Tags: #exercise, #motivation, #work  
  
---  
  If you think it’s simply enough to take advantage of the opportunities that arise in your life, you will fall short of greatness. Anyone sentient can do that. What you must do is learn how to press forward precisely when everyone around you sees disaster. ^660123337  
  
Tags: #motivation, #persistence  
  
---  
  Remember and remind yourself of a phrase favored by Epictetus: “persist and resist.” Persist in your efforts. Resist giving in to distraction, discouragement, or disorder. ^660123338

  Genius is the ability to put into effect what is in your mind. There’s no other definition of it. ^660123339  
  
Tags: #problem_solving

  What such a man needs is not courage but nerve control, cool headedness. This he can get only by practice. ^660123340  
  
Tags: #control, #courage, #practice  
  
---  
  Discipline in perception lets you clearly see the advantage and the proper course of action in every situation—without the pestilence of panic or fear. ^660123341  
  
Tags: #discipline, #perception  
  
---  
  When it comes to our actions, disorder and distraction are death. The unordered mind loses track of what’s in front of it—what matters—and gets distracted by thoughts of the future. The process is order, it keeps our perceptions in check and our actions in sync. ^660123342

  “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. Things that we had postponed for too long, that were long-term, are now immediate and must be dealt with. [A] crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before.” ^660123343  
  
Tags: #crisis, #opportunity  
  
---  
  We forget: In life, it doesn’t matter what happens to you or where you came from. It matters what you do with what happens and what you’ve been given. And the only way you’ll do something spectacular is by using it all to your advantage. ^802106752

  The struggle against an obstacle inevitably propels the fighter to a new level of functioning. The extent of the struggle determines the extent of the growth. The obstacle is an advantage, not adversity. The enemy is any perception that prevents us from seeing this. ^802106753  
  
Tags: #growth, #problem_solving  
  
---  
  Ordinary people shy away from negative situations, just as they do with failure. They do their best to avoid trouble. What great people do is the opposite. They are their best in these situations. They turn personal tragedy or misfortune—really anything, everything—to their advantage. ^802106754  
  
Tags: #perspective, #problem_solving, #stoic  
  
---  
  This is the skill that must be cultivated—freedom from disturbance and perturbation—so you can focus your energy exclusively on solving problems, rather than reacting to them. ^802106755  
  
Tags: #focus, #problem_solving, #stoic  
  
---  
  Failure shows us the way—by showing us what isn’t the way. ^802106756

  The great psychologist Viktor Frankl, survivor of three concentration camps, found presumptuousness in the age-old question: “What is the meaning of life?” As though it is someone else’s responsibility to tell you. Instead, he said, the world is asking you that question. And it’s your job to answer with your actions. ^802106757  
  
---  
  To do great things, we need to be able to endure tragedy and setbacks. We’ve got to love what we do and all that it entails, good and bad. We have to learn to find joy in every single thing that happens. ^802106758  
  
Tags: #failing, #stoic  
  
---  
  Focus on the moment, not the monsters that may or may not be up ahead. ^802106759  
  
Tags: #present, #stoic

  Uncertainty and fear are relieved by authority. Training is authority. It’s a release valve. With enough exposure, you can adapt out those perfectly ordinary, even innate, fears that are bred mostly from unfamiliarity. Fortunately, unfamiliarity is simple to fix (again, not easy), which makes it possible to increase our tolerance for stress and uncertainty. ^802106760  
  
---  
  The observing eye sees events, clear of distractions, exaggerations, and misperceptions. The perceiving eye sees “insurmountable obstacles” or “major setbacks” or even just “issues.” It brings its own issues to the fight. The former is helpful, the latter is not. ^802106761  
  
---  
  The next step after we discard our expectations and accept what happens to us, after understanding that certain things—particularly bad things—are outside our control, is this: loving whatever happens to us and facing it with unfailing cheerfulness. ^864019607

  What is defeat? Nothing but education; nothing but the first steps to something better. ^864019608

  To be physically and mentally loose takes no talent. That’s just recklessness. (We want right action, not action period.) To be physically and mentally tight? That’s called anxiety. It doesn’t work, either. Eventually we snap. But physical looseness combined with mental restraint? That is powerful. ^864019609

  The best men are not those who have waited for chances but who have taken them; besieged chance, conquered the chance, and made chance the servitor. ^864019610

  It’s three interdependent, interconnected, and fluidly contingent disciplines: Perception, Action, and the Will. ^864019611

  You don’t convince people by challenging their longest and most firmly held opinions. You find common ground and work from there. Or you look for leverage to make them listen. Or you create an alternative with so much support from other people that the opposition voluntarily abandons its views and joins your camp. ^864019612  
  
Tags: #negotiation

  Many of our problems come from having too much: rapid technological disruption, junk food, traditions that tell us the way we’re supposed to live our lives. We’re soft, entitled, and scared of conflict. Great times are great softeners. Abundance can be its own obstacle, as many people can attest. ^864019613  
  
Tags: #conflict, #perspective  
  
---  
  It’s okay to be discouraged. It’s not okay to quit. To know you want to quit but to plant your feet and keep inching closer until you take the impenetrable fortress you’ve decided to lay siege to in your own life—that’s persistence. ^864019614  
  
---  
  Stop pretending that what you’re going through is somehow special or unfair. Whatever trouble you’re having—no matter how difficult—is not some unique misfortune picked out especially for you. It just is what it is. ^864019615  
  
Tags: #problem_solving

  The task, as Pericles showed, is not to ignore fear but to explain it away. Take what you’re afraid of—when fear strikes you—and break it apart. ^864019616

---  
  It’s one thing to not be overwhelmed by obstacles, or discouraged or upset by them. This is something that few are able to do. But after you have controlled your emotions, and you can see objectively and stand steadily, the next step becomes possible: a mental flip, so you’re looking not at the obstacle but at the opportunity within it. ^970584677  
  
---  
  It might help to say it over and over again whenever you feel the anxiety begin to come on: I am not going to die from this. I am not going to die from this. I am not going to die from this. ^970584678  
  
---  
  Everything we do matters—whether it’s making smoothies while you save up money or studying for the bar—even after you already achieved the success you sought. Everything is a chance to do and be your best. Only self-absorbed assholes think they are too good for whatever their current station requires. ^970584679  
  
---  
  We craft our spiritual strength through physical exercise, and our physical hardiness through mental practice (mens sana in corpore sano—sound mind in a strong body). ^970584680  
  
---  
  Perspective is everything. That is, when you can break apart something, or look at it from some new angle, it loses its power over you. ^970584681  
  
---  
  The goal is: Not: I’m okay with this. Not: I think I feel good about this. But: I feel great about it. Because if it happened, then it was meant to happen, and I am glad that it did when it did. I am meant to make the best of it. ^970584682  
  
---  
  No one is coming to save you. And if we’d like to go where we claim we want to go—to accomplish what we claim are our goals—there is only one way. And that’s to meet our problems with the right action. ^970584683  
  
---  
  Think progress, not perfection. ^970584684  
  
---  
  We don’t get to choose what happens to us, but we can always choose how we feel about it. ^970584685
