  Some organizations try to replicate the success of a high-performing team by making other teams follow the same process. This is rarely successful, as each team works on different problems and has different skill levels. Just as the process and practices need to be context-specific, so do the metrics. ^691122942

Note: This is so true it hurts. This would be "artificial consistency". Dashboards only need to fulfill those who use them. It doesn't matter if they're different for each team.
