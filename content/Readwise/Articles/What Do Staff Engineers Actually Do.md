The most straightforward answer is that Staff engineers keep doing much of what made them successful as Senior engineers: building relationships, writing software, coordinating projects. However, that's a misleading answer. Staff engineers do those same tasks, but whereas previously they were the core of their work, now they're auxiliary tasks. Their daily schedule varies a bit [by archetype](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes), but there's a shared foundation across all archetypes: setting and editing technical direction, providing sponsorship and mentorship, injecting engineering context into organizational decisions, exploration, and what [Tanya Reilly](https://noidea.dog) calls [being glue](https://noidea.dog/glue). ^740743966

Note: Interesting that at this level we are finally seeing "being glue" as a positive.

One constant across all roles is that the reality of setting technical direction is far more about understanding and solving the real needs of the organization around you and far less about prioritizing technology and approaches that you personally are excited to learn about. ^740744298

You're far more likely to change your company's long-term trajectory by growing the engineers around you than through personal heroics. ^742659395
