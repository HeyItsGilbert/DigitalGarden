The expenditure of a finite amount of will. This can result in poor self-control choices. 

> Baumeisterâ€™s group has repeatedly found that an effort of will or self-control is tiring; if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around. The phenomenon has been named ego depletion. - Daniel Kahneman, _[[Reviews/Thinking, Fast and Slow|Thinking, Fast and Slow]]_

One example that comes to mind is that fact that certain folks like Zuck or Jobs would pre-define their wardrobe as a way to avoid ego depletion[^1].
