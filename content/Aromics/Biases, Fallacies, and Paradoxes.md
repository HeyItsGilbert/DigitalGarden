I enjoy learning about and observing biases. They impact our day-to-day lives and can be insideous if not kept in check. By learning about these, I can try to be more aware of them to reduce them in both myself and call them out in others (politely of course!).
# Bias
## Confirmation Bias
You only pay attention to facts that confirm what you already believe. This happens all the time. Poker. The news. Etc.

## Status Quo Bias
The belief that it must be done this way because it's always been done this way.

# Fallacy
## Sunk Cost Fallacy
An example: you have $600 in a pot, but all the facts tell you that you won't win your hand. But you still put in more because "you've already put this much".

## Information-Action Fallacy
If given the right information, you would change your behaviors.

# Paradoxes
An idea that seems counterintuitive or self contradictory.
## [[Strength of Weak Ties|Strength of Weak Ties]]
A paradox that shows we learn more from folks from outside of typical community.
