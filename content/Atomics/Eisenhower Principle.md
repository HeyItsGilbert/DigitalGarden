# In Tech Work
I've used this as a way to determine which projects should get worked on but more important when to be explicit about work that will never get done. I found that projects often ended up on a backlog but would never make the cut and would languish. If you were waiting on one of those projects it would be frustrating to see it never make progress.

|  | Urgent | Not Urgent |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Important** | These were projects that must be done and should be first priority. | These are things that will matter in the future and we should invest what time we have left over. |
| **Not Important** | These are things that should get delegated to teams with more bandwidth. Often Jr IC's or interns. | These are the tasks that should be elmiated. Don't drag these users along. Be clear about why it isn't a priority. |
