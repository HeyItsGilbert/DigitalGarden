# Highlights


  Unfinished tasks occupy the mind far more than completed ones because the mind constantly pulls what’s incomplete back into awareness.

Each recall refreshes the task’s or idea’s half-life in short-term memory, a process known as the Zeigarnik effect. That's why unfinished tasks are so distracting, regardless of their importance. ^350566836
