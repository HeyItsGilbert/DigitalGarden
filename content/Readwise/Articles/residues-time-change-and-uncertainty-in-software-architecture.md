  A hyperliminal system is a system where a complicated, ergodic, ordered system executes inside a complex, non-ergodic, disordered context. In this environment the context will constantly change and warp by definition. There will be constant flux. However, the complicated core will by definition be rigid and slower to respond to changes. With the wrong design, the changes in the context can cause the complicated core to fail. When this happens, it can be said that the architecture has failed. ^877699080

  This paradigm–the engineer- ing paradigm–has been the source of a great deal of the issues in software. Instead of learning to deal with an environment in constant flux we doubled down on prediction and control– attempting to push software engineering toward the zenith of traditional engineering. ^877699281

Note: Referencing the fact that software engineering has to deal with a constant state of flux.
