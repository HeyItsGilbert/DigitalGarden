  “Everyone thinks I have a death wish, you know? But I don’t want to die—dying is easy. No, I want to live, but getting close to death is the only way to feel alive. And once you do, it makes you realize that everything you were doing before wasn’t actually living. It was just making do. Call me crazy, but I think we do the best living when the stakes are high.” ^637136714

  “Strength and weakness are tangled things,” the Aven Essen had said. “They look so much alike, we often confuse them, the way we confuse magic and power.” ^637136715

  “But no afterlife,” grumbled the king. “No eternal soul? It’s unnatural.” “On the contrary,” said Kell. “It is the most natural thing in the world. Nature is made of cycles, and we are made of nature. What is unnatural is believing in an infallible man and a nice place waiting in the sky.” ^637136716

  Run away from what could have been a good life. Or at least a happy one. Because it wasn’t enough to be happy, not for Lila. She wanted more. Wanted an adventure. ^637136718

  Magic and magician must between them balance. Magic itself is chaos. The magician must be calm. A fractured self is a poor vessel for power, spilling power without focus or measure from every crack. ^637136719

  The truth was, Lila understood why Alucard did it. Why he traded safety and boredom for adventure. She didn’t know what it felt like to be safe, and she’d never had the luxury of being bored, but it was like she’d once told Kell. People either stole to stay alive or to feel alive. She had to imagine that they ran away for the same reasons. ^637136720

  “I honestly don’t know whether to be impressed or unnerved.” Lila straightened. “The two aren’t mutually exclusive.” ^637136722

  “Politics is a dance until the moment it becomes a war. And we control the music.” ^710665128

  My greatest fear in life isn’t dying. It’s being the source of someone else’s suffering. ^710665129

  People always said that waiting was the worst part, and Lila agreed. So much so, in fact, that she rarely waited for anything. Waiting left too much room for questions, for doubt. ^710665130

  Magic is tangled, so you must be smooth. Magic is wild, so you must be tame. Magic is chaos, so you must be calm. ^710665131

  “The thing about freedom, Kell? It doesn’t come naturally. Almost no one has it handed to them. I’m free because I fought for it. You’re supposed to be the most powerful magician in all the worlds. If you don’t want to be here, then go.” ^710665132

  “I always thought being an Antari meant you didn’t need to practice, that it all came”—he gestured absently—“naturally.” “The ability comes naturally,” replied Kell. “The proficiency takes work. ^710665136

  There used to be all kinds of aven. Ones who could master all the elements. Ones who could only master one, but were so powerful, they could change the tides, or the wind, or the seasons. Ones who could hear what magic had to say. Aven isn’t just one thing, because magic isn’t just one thing. It’s everything, old and new and always changing. ^710665137

  Kell would say it was impossible. What a useless word, in a world with magic. ^822726902

  Lila had never really bought into fate, but like most people who disavowed religion, she could summon a measure of belief when it was necessary. ^822726906

  “Look, everyone talks about the unknown like it’s some big scary thing, but it’s the familiar that’s always bothered me. It’s heavy, builds up around you like rocks, until it’s walls and a ceiling and a cell.” ^822726908

  “It doesn’t bother you, that everyone believes different things?” “Why should it?” he asked. “We all believe the same thing really, we simply give it different names. Hardly a crime.” ^822726910

  “The ability comes naturally,” replied Kell. “The proficiency takes work. Just as I explained during every one of your lessons.” ^986071362

  “I’ve found that watching is the quickest way to learn, and the safest way to stay alive.” ^986071363

  “Chaos needs order. Magic needs moderation. It’s like a fire. It doesn’t have self-control. It feeds off whatever you give it, and if you give it too much, it burns and burns until there’s nothing left. ^986071364

  “I’ll bring it all back,” said Lila, getting to her feet. “I have no use for a dress like this beyond tonight.” “Most women believe that a dress need only matter for one night.” ^986071365

  “Because too little of something is just as dangerous as too much.” ^986071366

  They crashed into each other as if propelled by gravity, and he didn’t know which of them was the object and which the earth, only that they were colliding. ^986071367

  Wasn’t magic supposed to be the thing in all things? If that was true, then it wasn’t about moving the water, it was about moving the magic. ^986071368

  “Please tell me this is easier to take off than it was to put on.” Calla raised a brow. “You do not think Master Kell knows how?” ^986071369

  Rhy held Kell’s pain in his hands, while Kell held Rhy’s life in his. ^986071370

  “I’ve seen people sin in the name of god, and in the name of magic. People misuse their higher powers, no matter what form they take.” ^986071371
