# Highlights


  The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this. ^348312716

  Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat. ^348312717

  The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. ^348312718

  Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. ^348312719

  You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. ^348312720

  Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. ^348312721

  How to Create a Good Habit The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious. The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying. ^348312722

  The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right. ^348312723

  Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent. ^348312724

  Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins. ^348312725

  Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe. ^491539045

  Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive. ^491539046

  The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. ^491539047

  The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. ^491539048

  The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases. ^491539049

  Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.” ^491539050

  The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician. ^491539051

  If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in. ^491539052

  One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking. ^491539053

Tags: #habits

---
  One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. ^491539054

  The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom. ^661919295

  The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. ^661919296

  You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. ^661919297

  When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive. ^661919299

  It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. ^661919300

  Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way. ^661919301

  As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals. ^661919302

Tags: #action, #habits

---
  A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision. ^661919303

  Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail. ^711101891

  Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do. ^711101892

  The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps. ^711101893

Tags: #habits

---
  The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious. Strategies like implementation intentions and habit stacking are among the most practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for when and where to take action. ^711101894

Tags: #habits, #systems

---
  Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. ^711101895

  Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. ^711101896

  “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.” ^711101898

  The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. ^711101899

  Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine. ^711101900

  Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees. ^815336832

  The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones. ^815336834

  When you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for work, study, exercise, entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find useful is “One space, one use.” ^815336835

  I know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the end of each month or year to see where they were correct and where they went wrong. ^815336836

  When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. ^815336837

  As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” ^815336838

---
  If you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad. ^815336839

Tags: #habits, #identity

---
  If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. ^815336840

Tags: #habits

---
  The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.” ^815336841
