> So here is the happiness trap in a nutshell: to find happiness, we try to avoid or get rid of bad feelings, but the harder we try, the more bad feelings we create.  
  
These can be typically looked at as "stories".  
  
A - Accept your thoughts and feelings  
C - Connect with your values  
T - Take effective action  
  
# Fusion and Defusion  
When we react to thoughts/stories as if they were true and give them our attention that is fusion. Defusion is acknowledging that these are stories and letting them be.

>  Anytime you're feeling stressed, anxious, or depressed, ask yourself, 'What story is my mind telling me now?' Then once you've identified it, defuse it.  
  
# The Observing Self  
ACT often refers to the observing self as the viewpoint (as opposed to the thinking self). By being cognizant of the observing self you can see how the thinking self is creating stories.

> The thinking self is responsible for thinking, in the broadest sense of the word; it produces all our thoughts, judgments, images, fantasies, and memories, and it is commonly called 'the mind.' The observing self is responsible for awareness, attention, and focus. It can observe thoughts, images, memories, etc., but it cannot produce them.  
  
# Expansion  
One technique to handle uncomfortable emotions.

> The four basic steps of expansion are: observe your feelings, breathe into them, make room for them, and allow them to be there.
