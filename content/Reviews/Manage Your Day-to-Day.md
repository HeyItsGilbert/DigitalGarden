An easy read that is a collection of various creative folks.
## Expertise
The section on “Honing Your Creative Practice” touches on the topic of doing creative things in the public.

> This is hard to do for two reasons: (1) it opens you to criticism, and (2) it puts you into the world as someone who knows what you are doing, which means tomorrow you also have to know what you are doing, and you have just signed up for a lifetime of knowing what you are doing.

This really resonated with me and had a clear line to my apprehension to blog or speak. I would say that the antidote to this fear is realizing that expertise is not knowing everything, but rather knowing something extremely well from the basis of your experience. An example could be being an expert of a piece of software that you've only ever run it on-prem. You may not have the experience of running it in the cloud, but that lack of experience is ok. Humility and openess to continue learning new things and the acceptance that it is impossible to know everything.
