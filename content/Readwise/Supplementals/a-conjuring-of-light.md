  “Love and loss,” he said, “are like a ship and the sea. They rise together. The more we love, the more we have to lose. But the only way to avoid loss is to avoid love. And what a sad world that would be.” ^646104160

  “You got something against killing?” pressed Vortalis. “I’ve taken lives,” answered Holland. “That’s not what I asked.” Holland fell silent. He clenched his fists, focused on the line of pain along his palm. At last, he said, “It’s too easy.” “Killing? Of course it is,” said Vortalis. “Living with it, that’s the hard part. ^718623912

  “The more you want something from someone,” added Lila, “the less they’ll want to part with it. If Maris finds out what we actually need, we’ll lose what power we have to bargain.” ^718623913

  “Are you strong enough to win?” she asked. This wasn’t a tournament magician. Wasn’t even a sliver of magic like Vitari. Osaron had destroyed an entire world. Changed another on a whim. “I don’t know,” he said honestly. Lila flashed a glimmer of a smile, sharp as glass. “Good,” she answered, pushing open the door. “Only fools are certain.” ^718623914

  Myths do not happen all at once. They do not spring forth whole into the world. They form slowly, rolled between the hands of time until their edges smooth, until the saying of the story gives enough weight to the words—to the memories—to keep them rolling on their own. ^852324787

  “Now tell me,” continued the captain, stacking her own hand, “what do you want?” “That’s a broad question.” “And an easy one. If you don’t know the answer, you don’t know yourself.” ^852324788
