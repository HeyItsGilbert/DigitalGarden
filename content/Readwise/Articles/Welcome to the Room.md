  *Welcome to the room!*  
*Congratulations …. your days of whining are over​.*  
*In this room, we deliver success, we don’t whine.​*  
*Look, I’m not confused, I know you walk through fields of shit every day.*   
*Your job is to find the rose petals.*  
*Don’t come whining that you don’t have the resources you need.​*  
*We’ve done our homework.*    
*We’ve evaluated the portfolio, considered the opportunities and allocated our available resources to those opportunities.*  
*That is what you have to work with.*   
*Your job is to manufacture success with the resources you’ve been allocated.*  
*And yes – you have a hard job.*  
*You only have 2 controls:​ 1) The clarity, culture, and energy you give your teams​; and  2) Resource allocation​.*  
*And I want to be clear with you.*  
*If you are in this room, you need to deliver outsized success.*    
*To do that, you will need to allocate resources ahead of conventional wisdom​.*    
*Conventional wisdom will generate conventional success and that won’t allow you to stay in this room.*    
*You need to have courage and be bold.*  
*And when you do that, you may fail.*  
*BUT.*    
*If you fail, I will back you if, and only if, you are “intellectually honest”.*  
*Intellectually honest means:*    
*1) ​You always have a plausible theory of success​.*  
*2) You allocate your resources in accordance to that theory*   
*3) You monitor your theory​*   
*4) When you find it is no longer plausible, you make changes to get a new plausible theory of success.*  
*If you are doing these things, I will back  you even if you have a failure.*  
*….*  
 *As long as you don’t make it a habit.* ^985997455

Note: Satya congratulating new executives.

  So strip away the happy talk and corporate-speak. ^985997552

Note: Good exec's must be 2 sides of a coin: the happy corporate speak for the external party, and the master craftsman who can apply ultra precise changes grounded in reality. If they fail at either, they are a liability.

---
  If you are an exec and don’t have the resources to support your strategy, you have the wrong strategy ^985998868

Note: Strategies must be grounded in the current reality.

  **“What signals will tell us whether our theory is plausible or not and how long will it be before we get those signals?”** ^985998931

Note: "Fail fast"

---
  **“Do the dots actually connect?”** ^985998956

Note: A pre-mortem. When you're ass is on the line, no one cares that another team dropped the ball.

---
  In the “Room,” you are judged by the outsized success you deliver, not by how busy you or your teams appear to be. ^985999060

---
  Your job is to provide the clarity, culture, and energy that allows a team to move. ^985999072

Note: This is the vision to get the org to believe in. And it requires it to be grounded in reality.
