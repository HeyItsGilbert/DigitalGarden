## What is Shape Up?

A product development methodology created by Ryan Singer at Basecamp. Focuses on fixed time, variable scope - ask "how much time is this worth?" instead of "how long will it take?"

## Key Concepts

### Appetite
Appetite allows getting buy in from leadership vs trying to estimate how long things take. The time boundaries are measurements of how much a project is worth to the team. It is fundamentally a business decision and not an estimate.
- Gut check
- Allows to treat aspects as tradeoffs.
- Sets boundaries before shaping work
- Drives scope decisions
- Comes BEFORE solution design

**Example**: A project to deploy an entire feature rich API gateway could take 6 months. OR you can take 6 weeks and implement something that solves 80% of the problem.

By leveraging the time constraint you can focus on what's important to you and the business.

### Shaping
The pre-work process of turning a raw idea into a bounded project ready for betting. Includes defining the problem, setting appetite, sketching solutions, and identifying risks.
- Must be rough enough for team creativity
- Must be clear enough to avoid rabbit holes
- Properties: Rough, Solved, Bounded

**Example**: "We need rolling updates without downtime" becomes a shaped project with identified components (orchestration, config management) but leaves implementation details to the team.

### Fat Marker Sketches
A visual technique used during shaping to communicate UI ideas without over-specifying details. Uses deliberately thick lines that prevent detailed wireframing.
- Shows flow and key elements, not exact layouts
- Leaves room for designer/developer judgment
- Alternative to detailed wireframes

**Note**: Shaping also uses "breadboarding" (text-based flow diagrams) for non-UI projects.

### Betting
Leadership commits to shaped projects for fixed time
- No extensions (circuit breaker)
- Small group decides priorities
- No endless backlog


> [!TIP] Circuit Break
> If a project doesn't ship in the allocated time it doesn't get an extension by default.

### Six-Week Cycles
- Long enough to build something meaningful
- Short enough to see the end from beginning
- Followed by 2-week cool-down period

## Why It Matters

Solves the problem of endless sprints, missed deadlines, and projects without clear boundaries. Keeps teams focused and shipping meaningful work.
