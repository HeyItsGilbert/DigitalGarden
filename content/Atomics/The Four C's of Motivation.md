 This was something that "ADHD Jesse" talked about in his _Avoiding Toxic Productivity Advice for ADHD_[^1] YouTube video. The four C's of motivation can be helpful to recognize how certain #work can be reframed to induce motivation for folks with [[ADHD|ADHD]].
## Captivate
Finding something that captivate your interest.
## Create
The novelty of creating something new. This can provide dopamine from the anticipation.
## Compete
The enjoyment of a good challenge.
## Complete
Setting due dates and deadlines. Applying urgency.
