# Highlights

A PowerShell process has the default [Runspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/hosting/creating-runspaces) which is the operating environment for the commands invoked by a host. In a Runspace, there is the global [SessionState](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/windows-powershell-session-state) object. When modules are imported to the global SessionState, a new SessionState object is created for each module. ^524325727

â€¢   Do not pass a ScriptBlock that is bound to a Runspace to another Runspace (Thread). ^524325830
