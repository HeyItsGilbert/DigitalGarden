  In the shows, I saw humans comfort each other all the time at moments like this. I had never wanted that and I still didn’t. (Touching while rendering assistance, shielding humans from explosions, etc., is different.)

  I was having an emotion, and I hate that. ^852741971

  I hadn’t been afraid that she wasn’t my friend, I had been afraid that she was, and what it did to me. ^852741972

  The one good thing about having emotions was that it accelerated the repair process for my memory storage. ^852741975

  The company is like an evil vending machine, you put money in and it does what you want, unless somebody else puts more money in and tells it to stop. ^852741976

  When I put the new clothes on, I had a strange feeling I usually associated with finding a new show on the entertainment feed that looked good. I “liked” these clothes. Maybe I actually liked them enough to remove the quotation marks around “liked.” I don’t like things in general that can’t be downloaded via the entertainment feed. Maybe because I’d picked them myself. ^852741978

  Sending SecUnits after me was one thing. But they sent SecUnits after my client. No one gets to walk away from that. ^895194784
