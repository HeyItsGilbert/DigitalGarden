# Highlights


  “Most people do. Most people would trade everything they know, everyone they know—they’d trade it all to know they’ve been seen, and acknowledged, that they might even be remembered. We all know we die. We all know the world is too big for us to be significant. So all we have is the hope of being seen, or heard, even for a moment.” ([6621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EGMQIJ0&location=6621)) %% Color: yellow %% ^348334819
