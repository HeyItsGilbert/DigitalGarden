Obsidian is a note taking app. Your notes are written in Markdown. The real magic of Obsidian is it's use of links and the graph it creates.

This site is built via Obsidian, [[Github Publisher|Github Publisher]], [[Quartz|Quartz]], [[Github|Github]], and [[Netlify|Netlify]]. You can see how I did at [[Publish to Quartz Repo|Publish to Quartz Repo]].
