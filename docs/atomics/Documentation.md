# Documentation
Documentation can take many forms and can be hot button issue.
## Types
My favorite take on this subject has been [Daniele Procida's talk at PyCon Australia 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4vKPhjcMZg). He argues that there are four types: Tutorials, How-To Guides, Discussions, and Reference. 

- Tutorials: Lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project.
- How-To Guides: Guides that take the reader through the steps required to solve a common problem.
- Discussions: Explanations that clarify and illuminate a particular topic.
- Reference: Technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it.
