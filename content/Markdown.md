One of the various markup languages that has probably gained the most traction. 

Alternatives are Asciidoc (adoc) and reStructureText (rST). Also, Markdown has a few different flavors such as Github-Flavored Markdown (GFM). Dewan Ahmed has a great article covering this called [Markdown, Asciidoc, or reStructuredText - A Tale of Docs-as-Code](https://www.dewanahmed.com/markdown-asciidoc-restructuredtext/).

Mikey is one of the amazing Documentarians at Microsoft working on [[PowerShell|PowerShell]] docs. His article [Writing Markdown](https://flagrant.garden/posts/writing-markdown/) is geared towards writing in VSCode, but it has some phenomenal recommendations.
