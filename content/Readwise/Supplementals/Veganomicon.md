  But food is in constant flux, traveling all over the world and taking root from one continent to the next. ^779876649

  Serve these as a precursor to the Red Lentil–Cauliflower Curry (page 186) or really any Indian dish. ^779876650

  PREHEAT THE oven to 400°F. In a large, deep baking pan, toss the onion rings with the olive oil to coat. Be sure to separate the rings and spread them out in the pan. Roast in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, stirring often. The idea is the get most of the onion rings deep brown, crisp, and even burned on the edges. The deeper they roast, the sweeter they’ll taste. When done, remove from the oven and set aside. Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Add the rice, cinnamon stick, ground cumin, and allspice. Bring back to a boil, then lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Uncover and add the lentils, stir gently only a few times (too much stirring can break the rice grains); cover, bring to boil again, lower the heat to low, and cook for an additional 45 minutes, until the liquid is completely absorbed. Remove from the heat and set aside the covered pot for 10 minutes. Use a fork to gently fluff the lentils and rice. Remove the cinnamon stick. Gently fold the caramelized onions into the lentils and rice, making sure to drizzle on any remaining olive oil from the roasting pan. Stir thoroughly. Serve warm or at room temperature. ^779876652
