Epictetus is reminding you that serenity and stability are results of your choices and judgment, not your environment. If you seek to avoid all disruptions to tranquility—other people, external events, stress—you will never be successful. Your problems will follow you wherever you run and hide. But if you seek to avoid the harmful and disruptive judgments that cause those problems, then you will be stable and steady wherever you happen to be.

“Keep this thought at the ready at daybreak, and through the day and night—there is only one path to happiness, and that is in giving up all outside of your sphere of choice, regarding nothing else as your possession, surrendering all else to God and Fortune.” —EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 4.4.39 ([334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=334)) %% Color: pink %% ^348334671

“We control our reasoned choice and all acts that depend on that moral will. What’s not under our control are the body and any of its parts, our possessions, parents, siblings, children, or country—anything with which we might associate.” —EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 1.22.10 ([347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=347)) %% Color: pink %% ^348334672

“Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with nature, and come to your final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened olive might drop, praising the earth that nourished it and grateful to the tree that gave it growth.” —MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 4.48.2 ([420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=420)) %% Color: pink %% ^348334673

“A podium and a prison is each a place, one high and the other low, but in either place your freedom of choice can be maintained if you so wish.” —EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.6.25 ([436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=436)) %% Color: pink %% ^348334675

“Your principles can’t be extinguished unless you snuff out the thoughts that feed them, for it’s continually in your power to reignite new ones. . . . It’s possible to start living again! See things anew as you once did—that is how to restart life!” —MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 7.2 ([450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=450)) %% Color: pink %% ^348334676

“Ask yourself the following first thing in the morning: What am I lacking in attaining freedom from passion? What for tranquility? What am I? A mere body, estate-holder, or reputation? None of these things. What, then? A rational being. What then is demanded of me? Meditate on your actions. How did I steer away from serenity? What did I do that was unfriendly, unsocial, or uncaring? What did I fail to do in all these things?” —EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 4.6.34–35 ([463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=463)) %% Color: pink %% ^348334677

“I will keep constant watch over myself and—most usefully—will put each day up for review. For this is what makes us evil—that none of us looks back upon our own lives. We reflect upon only that which we are about to do. And yet our plans for the future descend from the past.” —SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 83.2 ([482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=482)) %% Color: pink %% ^348334678

“From Rusticus . . . I learned to read carefully and not be satisfied with a rough understanding of the whole, and not to agree too quickly with those who have a lot to say about something.” —MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 1.7.3 ([514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=514)) %% Color: pink %% ^348334680

The more things we desire and the more we have to do to earn or attain those achievements, the less we actually enjoy our lives—and the less free we are. ([547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=547)) %% Color: yellow %% ^348334681

“Erase the false impressions from your mind by constantly saying to yourself, I have it in my soul to keep out any evil, desire or any kind of disturbance—instead, seeing the true nature of things, I will give them only their due.

There’s a saying—attributed to Bil Keane, the cartoonist—worth remembering: “Yesterday’s the past, tomorrow’s the future, but today is a gift. That’s why it’s called the present.” ([1250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=1250)) %% Color: yellow %% ^348334688

You are not your body and hair-style, but your capacity for choosing well. If your choices are beautiful, so too will you be.” —EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 3.1.39b–40a ([1267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=1267)) %% Color: yellow %% ^348334689

The diseases of the rational soul are long-standing and hardened vices, such as greed and ambition—they have put the soul in a straitjacket and have begun to be permanent evils inside it. To put it briefly, this sickness is an unrelenting distortion of judgment, so things that are only mildly desirable are vigorously sought after.” —SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 75.11 ([1350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=1350)) %% Color: yellow %% ^348334691

We cry to God Almighty, how can we escape this agony? Fool, don’t you have hands? Or could it be God forgot to give you a pair? Sit and pray your nose doesn’t run!

Every event has two handles—one by which it can be carried, and one by which it can’t. If your brother does you wrong, don’t grab it by his wronging, because this is the handle incapable of lifting it. Instead, use the other—that he is your brother, that you were raised together, and then you will have hold of the handle that carries.” —EPICTETUS, ENCHIRIDION, 43 ([2472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=2472)) %% Color: yellow %% ^348334698

Don’t let your reflection on the whole sweep of life crush you. Don’t fill your mind with all the bad things that might still happen.
