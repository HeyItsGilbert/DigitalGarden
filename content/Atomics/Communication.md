## Communication as a "Soft Skill"  
In the age of [[Large Language Models|ai]] the technical bar is coming down (not going away but still). This means that the era of "brilliant assholes" is probably coming to an end.  
## Conflict Resolution  
There are ways that you can resolve #conflict that don't use communication, but that's probably more violent then I need to write about (see any History book).  
  
Communication plays a key role in how we can resolve conflict. You may immedaitely think of negotiation with an adversary, but this could also apply to navigating difficult topics with a partner.
