[GitHub Publisher](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-mkdocs-publisher) is an extension by the wonderful Mara-Li. It allows you to push your notes to a GitHub repo. That combined with a variety of static site generators will allow you to create a site.

One of the beauties of the extension is that it will take things like dataview tables and render them into [[Markdown|Markdown]] tables. This means that what is uploaded is a table vs a scriptblock.
