A digital garden is when you have ~~all~~ many of your notes in the public. Not "all" because I'm looking at my Obisidian vault and there are a lot of unshared notes.

If we follow the garden analogy, the unpublished notes are the seeds in the packet. The shared notes, even in rough shape, are the seeds in the ground. While not completely polished, they have some semblence of being at least coherent (hopefully ðŸ˜‚).
