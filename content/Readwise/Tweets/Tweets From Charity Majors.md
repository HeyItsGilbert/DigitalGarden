  this is a good metaphor for becoming a senior engineer.  senior is a terminal level; you must advance so far, most won't advance farther.

a few will go on to staff or principal roles, just like a few doctors will go on to become medical administrators, instructors, or inventors. https://t.co/gockxzzG6K ^348840248
