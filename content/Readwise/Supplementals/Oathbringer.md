  The trick to happiness wasn’t in freezing every momentary pleasure and clinging to each one, but in ensuring one’s life would produce many future moments to anticipate. ^511740693

  ‘The question,’ she replied, ‘is not whether you will love, hurt, dream, and die. It is what you will love, why you will hurt, when you will dream, and how you will die. This is your choice. You cannot pick the destination, only the path.’ ^511740694

  “I will take responsibility for what I have done,” Dalinar whispered. “If I must fall, I will rise each time a better man.” ^511740695

  “Sometimes, a hypocrite is nothing more than a man who is in the process of changing.” ^511740696

  The most important step a man can take. It’s not the first one, is it? It’s the next one. Always the next step, Dalinar. ^511740698

  Failure is the mark of a life well lived. In turn, the only way to live without failure is to be of no use to anyone. Trust me, I’ve practiced.” ^511740699

  “All things exist in three realms, Dalinar,” Nohadon said. “The Physical: what you are now. The Cognitive: what you see yourself as being. The Spiritual: the perfect you, the person beyond pain, and error, and uncertainty.” ^511740701

  There are no foolish oaths. All are the mark of men and true spren over beasts and subspren. The mark of intelligence, free will, and choice. ^511740702

  But she had learned that nobody was strong all the time, not even Dalinar Kholin. Love wasn’t about being right or wrong, but about standing up and helping when your partner’s back was bowed. He would likely do the same for her someday. ^573081235

  Life was about momentum. Pick a direction and don’t let anything—man or storm—turn you aside. ^573081236

  “There is satisfaction,” he said to Dalinar, “in creating a list of things you can actually accomplish, then removing them one at a time. As I said, a simple joy.” ^573081237

  You can’t spend forever floating between worlds, Cousin, she thought. Eventually you’ll need to decide where you want to belong. Life was so much harder, but potentially so much more fulfilling, when you found the courage to choose. ^573081238

  Power was an illusion of perception, as Jasnah had said. The first step to being in control was to see yourself as capable of being in control. ^573081239

  Aim for the sun. That way if you miss, at least your arrow will fall far away, and the person it kills will likely be someone you don’t know.” ^573081240

  He needed more than vague explanations and abstract ideas—but those were the very soul of art. If you could explain something perfectly, then you’d never need art. That was the difference between a table and a beautiful woodcutting. You could explain the table: its purpose, its shape, its nature. The woodcutting you simply had to experience. ^573081241

  “But maybe you shouldn’t be looking for life to be easier because you choose to do something that is right! Personally, I think life is fair. It’s merely that often, you can’t immediately see what balances it.” ^573081242

  “I don’t mind people believing what works for them, Uncle. That’s something nobody ever seems to understand—I have no stake in their beliefs. I don’t need company to be confident.” ^573081243

  Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination. ^662989374

  “You learn more from bad art than you do from good art, as your mistakes are more important than your successes. Plus, good art usually evokes the same emotions in people—most good art is the same kind of good. But bad pieces can each be bad in their own unique way. So I’m glad we have bad art, and I’m sure the Almighty agrees.” ^662989375

  If the journey itself is indeed the most important piece, rather than the destination itself, then I traveled not to avoid duty—but to seek it. ^662989376

  It becomes the responsibility of every man, upon realizing he lacks the truth, to seek it out. ^662989377

  “Do you wish,” Wit asked, “that you could go back to not being able to see?” “No,” she whispered. “Then live. And let your failures be part of you.” ^662989378

  “Welcome to war, Evi,” Dalinar said, heading toward the door. “There are no unequivocal wins. Just victories that leave fewer of your friends dead than others.” ^662989379

  “The best indication of what human beings will do is not what they think, but what the record says similar groups have done in the past.” ^662989380  
  
---  
  “Power is a knife,” Wit said, taking his seat. “A terrible, dangerous knife that can’t be wielded without cutting yourself. We joked about stupidity, but in reality most people aren’t stupid. Many are simply frustrated at how little control they have over their lives. They lash out. Sometimes in spectacular ways…” ^842145279

  Lunamor didn’t push Renarin to talk. Some people you wanted to press, draw them out. Others you wanted to let move at their own pace. Like the difference between a stew you brought to a boil and one you kept at a simmer. ^662989381

  “I love tradition,” Dalinar said to Kadash. “I’ve fought for tradition. I make my men follow the codes. I uphold Vorin virtues. But merely being tradition does not make something worthy, Kadash. We can’t just assume that because something is old it is right.” ^842145280

  Art is about emotion, examination, and going places people have never gone before to discover and investigate new things. The only way to create something that nobody hates is to ensure that it can’t be loved either. Remove enough spice from soup, and you’ll just end up with water.” ^662989382

  What was that small spren that had crept out from beneath Eshonai’s corpse? It looked like a small ball of white fire; it gave off little rings of light and trailed a streak behind it. Like a comet. ^842145281

  Any chef worth his spoons learned to talk, because cooking was an art—and art was subjective. One man could love an ice sculpture while another thought it boring. It was the same with food and drink. It did not make the food broken, or the person broken, to not be liked. ^842145282

  “They will try,” Jasnah said, “to define you by something you are not. Don’t let them. I can be a scholar, a woman, a historian, a Radiant. People will still try to classify me by the thing that makes me an outsider. They want, ironically, the thing I don’t do or believe to be the prime marker of my identity. I have always rejected that, and will continue to do so.” ^842145283

  “Inappropriate?” Pattern said. “Such as … dividing by zero?” ^842145284

  “Ten spears go to battle,” he whispered, “and nine shatter. Did that war forge the one that remained? No, Amaram. All the war did was identify the spear that would not break.” ^842145285

  “I’m broken.” “Who isn’t? Life breaks us, Teft. Then we fill the cracks with something stronger.” ^842145286

  ‘Plan every battle as if you will inevitably retreat, but fight every battle like there is no backing down.’ ^842145287

  “Words are important,” Gavilar said. “Much more than you give them credit for being.” “Perhaps,” Dalinar said. “But if they were all-powerful, you wouldn’t need my sword, would you?” “Perhaps. I can’t help feeling words would be enough, if only I knew the right ones to say.” ^842145288

  You could not arrive at excellence by the average of these people. Excellence was an individual quest, not a group effort. ^987609068

  “One can believe in a story without believing it happened.” ^987609069

  Power could be an illusion of perception. Even within yourself. ^987609070

  She crouched in a dim room, hands touching the smooth stone floor, which had been eroded by thousands upon thousands of footfalls. If stone met a man, stone might win—but if stone met humanity, then no force could preserve it. ^987609071  
  
---  
  “The men like you, Sig, and they put a lot of stock in what you have to say. But you should try to understand what they want out of life, and respect that, rather than projecting onto them what you think they should want out of life.” ^987609072  
  
---  
  You should never debate an idiot, Shallan. No more than you’d use your best sword to spread butter.” ^987609073

  Honor’s power, during a storm, is concentrated in one place, the Stormfather said. It pierces all three realms and brings Physical, Cognitive, and Spiritual together momentarily in one. The gemstones, exposed to the wonder of the Spiritual Realm, are lit by the infinite power there. ^987609074

  “Every moment in our lives seems trivial,” Zahel said. “Most are forgotten while some, equally humble, become the points upon which history pivots. Like white on black.” ^987609075  
  
---  
  All life worked in concert, he’d been taught in his youth. Everything but men, who refused their place. Who destroyed instead of added. ^987609076  
  
---  
  “Shallan, you’re their commander. Maybe not their military commander, as they’re a civil guard, but it amounts to the same thing. Leave them idle, make them assume they’re inconsequential, and you’ll ruin them. Give them something important to do instead, work they’ll be proud of, and they’ll serve you with honor. A failed soldier is often one that has been failed.” ^987609077
