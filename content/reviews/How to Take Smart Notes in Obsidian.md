Book by [Josh Duffney](https://duffney.io/) about taking notes in [[Obsidian|Obsidian]]. 

My all time favorite quote which I like to use regularly when talking about [[Systems|Systems]]:
> Systems that allow complexity to build up in the wrong places eventually force you to choose between usability and usefulness.

Josh talks about a few things such as atomic notes, where Zettelkasten came from, and a few other bits. Very easy and quick read. 

Another excellent call out is: 
> When taking permanent notes, use your own words and never copy word for word, unless you're capturing a quote.
