  The original source for that anecdote about "the average hue of Starry Night" turns out to be @jrauser, at Velocity 2011. 🎉🥳🔥 O glorious day!

  It's easy to shit on averages. But then he turns to Moby Dick. "Moves awe in the soul." But if you lowercase & sort the words:  
  
min word: a  
max: zoroaster  
99th %: ye  
avg: ljklk  
  
(The average of a sample is often a value that doesn't even exist in the sample.)

But no one would argue that number teaches you much about those stories, just like no one goes to the museum to see #4c5c6d"

  "The problem only affected any one customer for a short period of time, and so the size of the impact was probably less than a pixel on a time series plot of our average latencies, but these were the worst-performing hits on the site." ^459685935

  "Because if you aren't looking at your data at least occasionally in its ✨rawest possible form✨, then you don't understand your business, and you almost certainly don't understand your customers." -- @jrauser  
  
Raw events: you can't have observability without them. Period.
