“The mystic nails a symbol to one meaning that was true for a moment but soon becomes false. The poet, on the other hand, sees that truth while it’s true but understands that symbols are always in flux and that their meanings are fleeting.” ([16690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0015DPXKI&location=16690)) %% Color: yellow %% ^589103529
