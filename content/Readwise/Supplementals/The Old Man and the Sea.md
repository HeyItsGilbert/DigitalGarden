# Highlights

You are killing me, fish, the old man thought. But you have a right to. Never have I seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills who. ^348313050

“Fish,” he said, “I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends.” Let us hope so, he thought. ^348313053

---
Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is. ^348313054

But, thank God, they are not as intelligent as we who kill them; although they are more noble and more able. ^348313056

---
It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready. ^348313057

---
“But man is not made for defeat,” he said. “A man can be destroyed but not defeated.” ^348313058

---
No one should be alone in their old age, he thought. But it is unavoidable. ^348313059

---
You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food, he thought. You killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman. You loved him when he was alive and you loved him after. If you love him, it is not a sin to kill him. ^548722172
