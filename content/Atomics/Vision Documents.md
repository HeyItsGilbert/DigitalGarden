# Vision Documents
I started writing this while trying to figure out how to write a two year vision doc for my team at Meta. These were inspired by an internal talk.
## Questions to ask yourself:
- Why does my team get paid to exist?
- Who are my actual customers?
- How can I best support them?
- Are you measuring success from the perspective of your customers?
- Do you tie your success to your customers' success? 
- What are the problems in my space that prevent me from best supporting them
- “IN A WORLD…. Where all my problems were solved… what happened between now and then to be standing there?”
- Outcomes of the solution ? 
- [[S.M.A.R.T Goals|S.M.A.R.T Goals]]?
- OODA?[^1]
