# Highlights

“Love and loss,” he said, “are like a ship and the sea. They rise together. The more we love, the more we have to lose. But the only way to avoid loss is to avoid love. And what a sad world that would be.” ([6061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EROMI2M&location=6061)) %% Color: yellow %% ^641686781
