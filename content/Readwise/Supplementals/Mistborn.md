  There was a group of people before the Ascension known as the Astalsi. They claimed that each person was born with a certain finite amount of ill luck. And so, when an unfortunate event happened, they thought themselves blessed—thereafter, their lives could only get better.” ^726952701

  “The emotions will fade, won’t they?” Vin said as a red-clothed serving girl entered the crowd. “Yes,” Breeze said, sitting back and sliding the panel closed. “But memories stay. If people associate strong emotion with an event, they’ll remember it better.” ^726952704

  “You ask why I smile, Goodman Mennis? Well, the Lord Ruler thinks he has claimed laughter and joy for himself. I’m disinclined to let him do so. This is one battle that doesn’t take very much effort to fight.” ^726952705

---
  “That’s the funny thing about arriving somewhere, Vin,” he said with a wink. “Once you’re there, the only thing you can really do is leave again. ^823908145

  She had always been forced to fight to find privacy. Being given it so easily seemed to devalue the years she had spent relishing her brief moments of solitude. ^823908146

  Kelsier shrugged. “I think…I think given the choice between loving Mare—betrayal included—and never knowing her, I’d choose love. I risked, and I lost, but the risk was still worth it. It’s the same with my friends. Suspicion is healthy in our profession—but only to an extent. I’d rather trust my men than worry about what will happen if they turn on me.” ^823908149

  “Strength is a big part of fighting, but it’s not the only part. If you always hit your hardest, you’ll tire faster and you’ll give your opponent information about your limitations. A smart man hits his hardest at the end of a battle, when his opponent is weakest. And, in an extended battle—like a war—the smart soldier is the one who survives the longest. He’ll be the man who paces himself.” ^823908151

  Men rarely see their own actions as unjustified. ^823908152

  “Inquisitor!” Breeze said, pointing toward a robed figure standing before Kelsier. “What?” Dockson said, standing. It’s a trap, Vin realized with horror. Soldiers began to pile into the square, appearing from hidden side streets. ^951014061

---
  The man who wants you to trust him is the one you must fear the most. ^951014062

---
  Betrayal had nothing to do with friendship; it was a simple fact of survival. ^951014063

---
  If the army were made up of one-legged mutes, he would praise their balance and their listening skills.” ^951014064

---
  “You’re late, Kell,” Dockson said, still not looking up from his ledgers. “I strive for nothing if not consistency,” ^951014065

---
  I never wanted to be feared. If I regret one thing, it is the fear I have caused. Fear is the tool of tyrants. Unfortunately, when the fate of the world is in question, you use whatever tools are available. ^951014066

  “Think about it. What is a man doing when he seeks the affection of a young lady? Why, he is trying to manipulate her to regard him favorably. What happens when two old friends sit down for a drink? They tell stories, trying to impress each other. Life as a human being is about posturing and influence. This isn’t a bad thing—in fact, we depend upon it. These interactions teach us how to respond to others.” ^951014067

---
  Ham nodded. “I’m a Thug.” Vin frowned in confusion. “I burn pewter,” Ham said. Again, Vin looked at him questioningly. “He can make himself stronger, my dear,” Breeze said. “He hits things—particularly other people—who try to interfere with what the rest of us are doing.” ^951014068

  “Many high noblemen only have access to a single Allomantic skill. People like that—those who can only perform Allomancy in one of its eight basic aspects—are called Mistings. Sometimes these abilities appear in skaa—but only if that skaa has noble blood in his or her near ancestry. You can usually find one Misting in…oh, about ten thousand mixed-breed skaa. The better, and closer, the noble ancestry, the more likely the skaa is to be a Misting.” ^951014069

---
  He fought against a thousand years of conditioning, a thousand years of life in a society that would label the deaths of five thousand men as a “great victory.” Life was so hopeless for the skaa that they’d been reduced to finding comfort in expected defeats. ^951014070
