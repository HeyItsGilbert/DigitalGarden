  The **madman** is coming up with great ideas all the time which might not be related to anything.
The **architect** is providing structure to the writing; moving paragraphs around and looking at the story-line.
The **carpenter** is crafting the sentences, phrases, and word choice.
The **judge** is deleting unnecessary parts. ^454462859
