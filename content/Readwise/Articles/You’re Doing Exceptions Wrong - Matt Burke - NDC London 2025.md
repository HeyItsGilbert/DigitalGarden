  indebted to this article called vexing exceptions by Eric ^951948710

---
  our advice on these particular two types of exceptions is it's not worth writing a catch block specifically for them if they occur your program is dead in the water ^951968194

---
  his exception is not a bug itself it is telling you about a bug that you already have and so the key thing that we think is important is that you don't try to catch these exceptions instead you should prevent them from happening in the first place they're telling you about a bug you already have ^951968906
