  Ever since that first monkey looked up into the sky and saw something twinkling up there, you meat puppets have tried to force twenty pounds of existential meaning into a ten pound sack of chaos. ^779878569

  This next one was in the AI’s creepy, I’m touching myself voice. I suppressed a shudder. New Achievement! You got eaten by a monster much bigger than yourself, and you managed to get out without even getting chewed a little bit. I think Daddy kinda liked that. I think it moved. We’re gonna have to do some experimenting with this one. Reward: You’ve received a Platinum Spicy Box. ^943007984

  I would think of that day and remember how easy it was to grow numb and not even realize it. ^943007985

  Mordecai: A platinum emergency box? Are you shitting me? Do you know how much that had to cost? That had to be more than the GDP of some star systems. That had to be the most expensive box in the game’s history! Carl: Yeah, my first instinct was to abort everything and run down the stairs, but I figured we might as well look at it. Whoever these guys are, they must want this plan to go smoothly. ^943007987

  Odds are even better you don’t know who Vesta Stoudt is. ^943007988

  Langley cracked his neck. He was now level 32. He’d gained eight levels since I’d first met him. “We’re going down there, and we’re going to keep doing what we’ve been doing. Katia asked if we wanted to work with her new team, but I am thinking we might join up with some others. There are many large groups forming. The Popov brothers are looking for archers. They wish to hunt down team Cichociemni, who have been preying on weak crawlers. We need to break up the player killer groups before they get too strong, so we might join up with them.” ^943007989

  After some very careful discussions, some unfortunate litigation that we won, and with the input from the Syndicate, we have decided to allow this method of bubble escape to continue. However, we have been forced to block some—but not all—of the secondary summonings. The feral gods who’ve been escaping are random, and sometimes new even to us. Each feral who appears has a 66% chance to summon a corresponding deity. One of the resulting summoned gods was Ysalte, the Vinegar Bitch. That would have been an extinction-level event for this floor and the next. As exciting as that would be, we still have another floor of sponsorship bidding to get through before we can allow it. ^943007990

  I’d cut my nail 3/4s off, but close to the finger so it wasn’t noticeable. The panel thing was such an utter piece of crap, it easily fell off with just a little foreign object. In fact, it was so flimsy, so easy to fall off, I was starting to suspect the toy had actually been a low-effort assassination attempt on us. When I’d leaned in to tap on the glass and ask Loita if the trailer could go into space, thus confirming Loita was really there thanks to the moisture, I’d attempted to get my nail in place, but it’d slipped out. I’d had to lean in a second time to get it right. I leaned over the couch, and I’d made the move with my left hand, pressing the robot toy against my chest. In the end, it’d been simple. I held the panel in place as I pulled my hand away. When I placed the toy on the couch next to the admin, I’d pulled away with enough force to dislodge my fingernail, which held the panel precariously in place. I practically crapped myself when the robot Donut had turned its head to say some creepy shit to Loita. But the little panel had held. It wasn’t visibly loose. But I knew it would go flying the moment it jumped to the ground. When I’d told robot Donut to stay by the admin, I knew the heavy robot would jump off the couch the moment she’d stood up. Loita had been so distracted by my attempted extortion of Veriluxx, she likely never noticed the little piece of plastic falling off the cat and landing on the carpet. And that’s what killed her. “I’m not signing anything because I have nothing to give up, nobody to rat out,” I said. “And believe me, I’d love to get a free legendary box. But I have nothing to give you in exchange. This was an accident. But you’re obviously not an idiot, so I won’t lie to you. I wish I had thought of this. I wish I had outside help because if I did and thought I could’ve gotten away with it, I would’ve done it without hesitation, but I wouldn’t have wasted the opportunity on some low-level bitch like Loita.” Donut, still on my shoulder, was stiff as a board. The faceless man said nothing for a moment. “And who would you have used it on, then?” I didn’t answer. There were only so many lines I could cross. There was so much I wanted to say. I thought of Brandon. Of Yolanda. Of everybody else in the world. They had all died, and nobody cared. Yet someone like Loita died, and we had to go through all of this? You will not break me. Fuck you all. I will break you. I will break you all. Orren sighed and pulled the paper away. “Very well. As we are unable to determine what happened and no consensus exists regarding the incident, I have no choice but to recommend that the Syndicate close the matter. However, you should know we have implemented a punitive measure onto Borant for the remainder of this floor, as this wasn’t an isolated incident. No crawlers will be allowed to be teleported away by third parties until the next floor opens. ^943007991

  You and I have been named co-defendants in an action brought to the Syndicate Court by a third party, and we have been deemed—drum roll please—victorious! Why did they sue us? If you don’t already know why, you probably will never know. This is a rare event, but when it happens, crawlers usually lose these fights since they can’t afford a lawyer, being slaves and all. Plus I’ll throw you under the bus quicker than you can say “Arch Support.” But that doesn’t matter because today, victory is ours! Chalk one up for the little guy! This is one of the rare achievements that may be awarded more than once. ^943007992
