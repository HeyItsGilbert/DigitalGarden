# Highlights  
  
  
  Kids aren’t always a product of their parents. But sometimes that doesn’t matter. Sometimes parents can cast a shadow so thick, you can drown in it. ^779879454

  “It is all a mockery of our faiths and legends. They ignore the meanings behind the myths and stories, and they just see the surface, steal it, and use it to make something shiny and pretty and completely devoid of its meaning. ^882434373

  You look that shit up in Wikipedia, and it’ll be the first line. It’ll say, “These bitches are three pugs short of a grumble.” It’s not an opinion, but an absolute fact. ^960068370

  But that’s just life. At least they fucking tried. They died with their boots on, as much as I hate that expression. They died with their boots on for their people, their family, not for some rich, nameless organization that gives no shits whether they live or die. Or go extinct. Or are trapped for a millennia after they’re done being used. ^960068371

  And hell, my child, hell is not just a place. It is a contagion. It is a virus. It spreads. But worst of all, it attracts. ^960068372

  “Jola, keep the worm off our back!” Jola wasn’t listening to me. He only had eyes for Quan. “Mér líkar ekki úlpan þín.” ^960068373

  You did not diffuse your soul power from the Scavenger’s Daughter. That was a mistake. You should never allow it to linger within you. I need you alive, Carl. I need you reasonably sane. We have so much work to do. I felt an ominous chill, both at the words spoken in my mind and at the realization that I had, indeed, forgotten to activate my Daughter’s Kiss. ^960068374

  Just because they act up from time to time. You skin one little warren of rabbits, you spray the innards of a chatty, overweight Soother tourist all over the gift shop, and everybody is suddenly “scared.” What about my wants? I’m older than time as you know it. ^960068375

  “It’s Heyzoos, the Uzi Jesus!” the announcer shouted as the words appeared floating in the air. Heyzoos flexed, and the cross shattered into holographic dust as the barefooted man landed on the tiled floor of the mall, his white robe flapping in a wind that wasn’t there. His long, flowing hair also waved. A golden halo over his head sparkled. A 75-second timer appeared over him and started to count down. ^960068376

  I thought of Ren, and of the hopelessness that had broken her. Of all these crawlers who’d been forced to confront their own personal nightmares on this floor. Of my mother, who’d drowned in her own sorrow. Of the stepmother I’d never met, and what she’d done. Of the goddamned river that was so loud it was the only thing I could hear. It was loneliness. It had always been loneliness. ^960068377

  New Achievement. Apex Predator. They’re dead. All of them. Not only did you kill more hunters than everyone else, but you killed the very last one. One could fill a very stinky swimming pool with the blood you spilled on the Hunting Grounds. You have become a very scary dude. Maybe I should be calling you daddy instead of the other way around. Reward: Nothing! ... Just kidding. You have received a Celestial Predator Box. ^960068378

  Squonk – Level 35. Eastern United States Region Legendary Creature. The Squonk. The poor, pitiful Squonk. ^960068379
