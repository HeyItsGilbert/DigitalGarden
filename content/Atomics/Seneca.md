## Quotes 
> Our minds must have relaxation: rested, they will rise up better and keener. Just as we must not force fertile fields, for uninterrupted production will quickly exhaust them, so continual labor will break the power of our minds. They will recover their strength, however, after they have had a little freedom and relaxation.” 
_On Tranquility of the Mind, XVII_

> The ones who pioneered these paths aren't our masters, but our guides. Truth stands open to everyone; it hasn't been monopolized. 

> Let philosophy scrape off your own faults, rather than be a way to rail against the faults of others.
