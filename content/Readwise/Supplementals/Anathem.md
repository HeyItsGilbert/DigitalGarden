“The mystic nails a symbol to one meaning that was true for a moment but soon becomes false. The poet, on the other hand, sees that truth while it’s true but understands that symbols are always in flux and that their meanings are fleeting.” ^589042140

They knew many things but had no idea why. And strangely this made them more, rather than less, certain that they were right. ^589042145

---
And it happened all the time that the compromise between two perfectly rational alternatives was something that made no sense at all. ^589042146

“Our opponent is an alien starship packed with atomic bombs,” I said. “We have a protractor.” ^589042147
