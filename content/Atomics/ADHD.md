Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder. This note should really be way more verbose and have a ton more links… but… you know. This is a WIP!
## Accomodations
ADA recognizes ADHD as a disability, and you can often ask your employer for accomodations if you have a Doctor who can approve the need. The Job Accomodation Network has a great article on [Accommodation and Compliance: ADHD](https://askjan.org/disabilities/Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity-Disorder-AD-HD.cfm?cssearch=3054246_1).
