- Specific
- Measurable
- Attainable
- Relevant
- Time-bound

This acronym helps create goals that are more likely to be succesful. This was used in Noom when tracking personal health goals.
## Example
An example of a goal that wouldn't be SMART.

> Make the service better.

- Not Specific
    - Which service? Better how?
- Not Measureable
    - User sentiment? Uptime?
- Attainable?
    - Maybe. But the goal is too vague to be certain.
- Not Relevant
    - Too vague to portray relevence. Maybe the service is perfectly fine. 
- Not Time-bound
    - Make the service better by when? Friday? Next quarter? Next year?

A good version:

> Reduce avg server load time by 50% by Q3
- Specific
    - This is targetting a specific metric (avg server load) by a specific amount (50%).
- Measurable
    - The load time is a measurable metric which you can refer to see if you're succesful.
- Attainable
    - This will depend on the goal and the people doing the work.
- Relevant
    - This is specific enough that the team could decide if this is relevant. Maybe server load isn't important, but now that's an easier discussion.
- Time-bound
    - "by Q3" gives us timeline for when this should happen.

Goals can be missed or improperly measured but by starting with with a solid SMART goal you can understand where things went awry and/or course correct earlier. Sometimes projects fail due to unforseen circumstances, but remember that's called experience.
