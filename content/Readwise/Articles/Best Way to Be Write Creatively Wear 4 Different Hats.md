The **madman** is coming up with great ideas all the time which might not be related to anything. The **architect** is providing structure to the writing; moving paragraphs around and looking at the story-line. The **carpenter** is crafting the sentences, phrases, and word choice. The **judge** is deleting unnecessary parts. ^454462859
