  We all have it. Whether it gets you up in the morning or keeps you up at night, you've felt it: creative potential. ^686375657

  To create, we must first recognize its inverse: consumption. Consumption is a useful stage, but can be dangerous if it’s terminal. An infinite loop in this stage kills any chance of creation. But little is created in a vacuum. Creation still starts with consumption, albeit consumption disarmed with an intention: Research and critique ^686376192

  If you're not reflecting, you're not learning ^686376370

Note: It's interesting to consider how this is geared towards creativity but so closely aligns with things like philosophical thought. Not to mention a clear parallel to therapeutic journaling.

  More generally, be wary of one-size-fits-all solutions; while prescriptive techniques such as the [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/) may work for some, creation is idiosyncratic. Embrace your own process. ^686416327

Note: Taking what works and making your own system that you enjoy is the path to success.

  There are a few notable benefits of intentional creation:

1.  When you've built something, the influences are well-documented. It can be easier to involve others when there's a clear creative thread to pull on.
    
2.  Sharing your critiques and curations invites collaboration with other creators and curators.
    
3.  Self-awareness. If you're not finding your critiques crystallizing into new thoughts and ideas for projects, that's a sign you're looking at the wrong stuff. Are you following your interests or passively consuming trending content? ^687327909
