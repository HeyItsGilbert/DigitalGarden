# Highlights


  I tried TDD for years—and this is what no one tells you:

1) Full coverage isn’t a shield—it just looks nice on paper.
2) Bugs love slipping past the most confident tests.
3) Maintenance is harder when your tests don’t tell the story. 
4) TDD only works if you stick to it—and most don’t. 
5) The best developers aren’t the ones with 100% coverage—they know where it matters. 
6) Code evolves faster than tests can keep up. 
7) Unit tests don’t find all bugs—just the ones you thought of.
8) Writing tests can save others more time than it saves you.
9) Unit tests document your assumptions more than your logic.
10) Sometimes deleting old tests is the smartest move you’ll make.
