A never nester doesn't dare to go four deep ^443313603

At the beginning of this video, I mentioned that LinusTorvalds is a suspected never nester. And I say this because in the Linux kernel style guidelines they stateif you need more than three levels of indentation, you're screwed anywayand should fix your program.The kernel dudes are always so dramatic.They visually enforce thisby making the tab size eight characters wide. ^443313870

Note: A funny way to reduce nesting is by making it ugly.
