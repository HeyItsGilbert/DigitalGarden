# Hey! It's Gilbert's Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

Hi all, welcome to my [[DigitalGarden|DigitalGarden]]. I've been taking a lot of notes in [[Obsidian|Obsidian]] and I came across some Digital Garden's. I love the idea of learning in Public, so I decided to give it a go.

Unlike my [blog](https://gilbertsanchez.com/) the idea is that these are notes at various stages of completion. Often I like to have a concrete idea and goal around what my blog posts should teach/convey. This often leaves a lot of knowledge behind this barrier of completion.

At some point I'll document how I built this site with [[Obsidian|Obsidian]] and [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). I went through various iterations using [[PowerShell|PowerShell]] scripts, [[Hugo|Hugo]], and [[MkDocs|MkDocs]].

## Map's of Content
I have a few (ha!) interests and these are the categories of how I break them down.
